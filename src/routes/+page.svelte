            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I have always been intrigued by the inner workings of computers, 
                fascinated by how these machines perform complex tasks. 
                This curiosity led me to pursue a deeper understanding of computer technology, 
                and when I entered college, I eagerly took on the challenge of studying Computer Systems Engineering. 
                Now, in my third year, my initial curiosity has deeper appreciation for the field. 
                Through various challenging projects and courses, I have developed a solid foundation of skills and knowledge, 
                preparing me for the evolving technological industry and reinforcing my commitment to a 
                career in computer systems engineering.

                Outside the computer, you'll find me at basketball court, reading, playing with my dog and playing chess.
